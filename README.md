## ‚≠ê How To Install?

To be able to use this properly, you need to choose between the three versions of this portfolio. If you want to make sure that it'll work for you, just don't install it via the master branch, because it won't start for you. There are 3 versions down below, depending on what you choose, you will have to do different things to make it fully working.

### Choose your version:

* <a href="#contentful">Contentful blog</a>

* [Markdown blog](https://github.com/bartzalewski/bartzalewski.com-v2/tree/md-blog)

* [No blog](https://github.com/bartzalewski/bartzalewski.com-v2/tree/no-blog)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Using it as Your Portfolio

As I'm making this repo public for all, you can easily get it and use it how you want. But, there is a must. You need to attribute me. You must leave alone the attribution under the copyright statement ("Created By Bart Zalewski").

In the beginning, I created this website only for myself, for portfolio purposes. Now, you can just download it and use it for your purposes.

### TL;DR

You can fork this repository, but please give me proper credit by linking back to my website - [bartzalewski.com](https://bartzalewski.com).

Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
